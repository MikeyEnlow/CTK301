    <p>Formed in high school in Central Illinois, alternative rock band UNCHAiNED has captivated audiences with their high-energy live shows and nostalgic 90s alternative sound. Their expansive catalog blends rock, ska, funk, and reggae, creating an infectious appeal that keeps fans dancing and their hands in the air.</p>
